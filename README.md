# To-do-Next-JS
# To-Do Next.js App

This project is a simple To-Do list application built with **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 
It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them. 
The tasks are stored in a MongoDB database for persistent storage, 
and the user interface is designed with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive experience. This app demonstrates the use of modern web technologies for building a fast and efficient task management tool.
